Technology affects people all over the world, both positively and negatively. While I do agree that advances in technology have made our countries safer and our lives easier, they have also negatively affected our lives. My parents did not grow up in front of a computer or a PlayStation. They did not spend hours each day looking at what their virtual friends are doing on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Instead, they went out with flesh and blood friends, played football, or simply took a walk in the woods. But, of course, they didn’t pay for an ice cream using a credit card and didn’t buy movie tickets online.

Advances in technology have brought us online banking, smart cars, smart TVs, lightning fast computers, and the latest buzz: virtual reality. However, they also brought us cyber warfare, hackers, identity theft, cyber stalking, and a host of other bad things. Also, people started getting lazy and more ignorant. Long gone are the days when people were flocking to the library – if only to do some research for a school assignment. Nowadays, one can find everything on the Internet. Instead of playing some football or having a fun snowball fight, children are playing video games for hours.

Bicycles have been replaced by e-bikes (electric bikes). Rollerblades have been replaced with electric motorized skates. Yes, they’re fun; can’t argue with that! However, they are making children more sedentary. And, as you know, a sedentary lifestyle has major negative health consequences. People are slowly forgetting that physical activity is an important part of a balanced and healthy lifestyle. Consequently, advances in technology are having negative effects on our health.

I agree that technology has taken us to Mars. Many crimes no longer go unpunished due to innovative technologies that help criminal investigators find the culprits. Thousands of lives are saved each year by the latest medical technologies (used to perform complex surgeries and identify life-threatening diseases). There is no question about it: technology is an integral part of our daily lives.

In conclusion, it all depends on how you use technology. It is slowly taking over the world and you can find it everywhere around you. How you use technology is important. It is designed to make our lives easier, but should never be replacing physical exercise, walking, reading, and socializing with real human beings.
